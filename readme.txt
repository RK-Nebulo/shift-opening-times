== Description ==
This plugin adds an Opening Times options page into wp-admin and allows the user to enter opening hours for their store

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress


== Changelog ==

= 1.0 =
* First version


== Future Roadmap ==

* Give possibility to add exceptions
** Will override standard weekly and bank holiday times
** Allow runs of days to be implemented - incase the store is closed for a week, for example

* Live update of the current opening status
** Use AJAX to update the status when a user is on the page as the open/close time passes

* Update admin interface
** Currently the options page is quite long, so bringing some fields onto the same lines will help shorten the length
